# Asynchronous Python

## Course Overview
This module covers asynchronous programming in Python - a powerful approach to handling operations that involve waiting, such as network requests, database queries, and file I/O. By the end of this course, you'll understand how to write efficient, non-blocking code that can significantly improve performance in I/O-bound applications.

## Prerequisites
- Good understanding of Python fundamentals
- Knowledge of functions, error handling, and basic program flow
- Familiarity with decorators and generators (recommended but not required)

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the concepts of concurrency, parallelism, and asynchronous programming
- Master Python's asyncio framework and syntax
- Learn when (and when not) to use asynchronous programming
- Gain practical experience writing asynchronous code for real-world scenarios
- Understand common patterns and best practices for async programming
