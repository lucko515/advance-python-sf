# Data Analysis with Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib

This module provides a comprehensive introduction to data analysis in Python using the most popular libraries: NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The course is designed for intermediate Python developers who want to learn how to efficiently work with, analyze, and visualize large datasets.

## Course Overview

This 2-hour course introduces the essential tools and techniques for data analysis in Python, with a focus on real-world applications. We'll work with a loan applications dataset to demonstrate how these libraries can be used together to extract valuable insights.

## Topics Covered

1. **NumPy Basics** (01_numpy_basics.py)
   - Introduction to NumPy arrays and their advantages
   - Memory efficiency and performance comparisons
   - Creating and manipulating arrays
   - Basic array operations

2. **Advanced NumPy** (02_numpy_advanced.py)
   - Broadcasting concepts with practical examples
   - Vectorization for performance optimization
   - Advanced array manipulation techniques
   - Universal functions (ufuncs)

3. **Pandas Basics** (03_pandas_basics.py)
   - Introduction to Series and DataFrame objects
   - Reading data from CSV files
   - Data exploration and information gathering
   - Indexing, selection, and filtering data
   - Handling missing values

4. **Advanced Pandas** (04_pandas_advanced.py)
   - GroupBy operations for data aggregation
   - Pivot tables and cross-tabulations
   - Merging, joining, and concatenating DataFrames
   - Working with dates and times
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing
   - Advanced indexing and vectorized operations

5. **Matplotlib Basics** (05_matplotlib_basics.py)
   - Creating and customizing plots
   - Different plot types (line, scatter, bar, histogram, etc.)
   - Working with multiple subplots
   - Customizing plot appearance
   - Saving figures to files
   - Visualizing the loan dataset

6. **Integrated Analysis** (06_integrated_analysis.py)
   - Complete end-to-end analysis workflow
   - Feature engineering
   - Exploratory data analysis
   - Building predictive models
   - Visualizing results
   - Extracting insights and recommendations

## Dataset

The course uses a `loan_applications.csv` dataset containing information about loan applications, including:

- Applicant demographics (age, gender, education, occupation)
- Loan details (amount, term, interest rate, monthly payment)
- Financial information (income, credit score, existing loans)
- Application outcome (default or not)

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with core Python data structures
- No prior experience with data analysis libraries is required

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Load, clean, and preprocess data using Pandas
- Perform efficient numerical computations with NumPy
- Create informative visualizations with Matplotlib
- Apply these tools to extract insights from real-world datasets
- Integrate all three libraries in a complete data analysis workflow

## Exercises

Each script includes exercises at the end to help reinforce the concepts covered. Solutions are provided for instructors.
