# Debugging and Profiling Python Code

This module covers advanced techniques for debugging and profiling Python code, a critical skill for professional developers. In these lessons, we'll move beyond print statements to explore powerful tools and methodologies for identifying, diagnosing, and fixing bugs efficiently.

## Course Overview

This course is designed for intermediate-level Python developers who want to improve their debugging and code optimization skills. The content spans 2 hours and covers best practices, tools, and techniques for debugging Python code.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. Apply systematic debugging methodologies to solve complex bugs
2. Use Python's built-in debugging tools effectively
3. Debug Python applications using VS Code's debugging features
4. Identify and fix common Python bugs and anti-patterns
5. Profile code to identify performance bottlenecks
6. Optimize code based on profiling results

## Prerequisites

- Good understanding of Python fundamentals
- Familiarity with Python functions, classes, and error handling
- VS Code installed (for the IDE debugging section)

## Course Structure

The course is organized into the following lessons:

1. **Debugging Basics** (`01_debugging_basics.py`)
   - Moving beyond print statements
   - Understanding error messages and tracebacks
   - Defensive programming and error handling
   - Using logging instead of print statements

2. **Python Debugger (pdb)** (`02_python_debugger.py`)
   - Introduction to the Python debugger
   - Setting breakpoints and inspecting variables
   - Navigating code execution with step commands
   - Post-mortem debugging
   - Using conditional breakpoints

3. **VS Code Debugger** (`03_vscode_debugger.py`)
   - Setting up the VS Code debugging environment
   - Using the VS Code debugging interface
   - Working with breakpoints, watch expressions, and the call stack
   - Debugging with logpoints
   - Multi-file debugging techniques

4. **Common Bugs** (`04_common_bugs.py`)
   - Understanding different types of bugs (syntax, runtime, logical)
   - Python-specific bugs and anti-patterns
   - Debugging strategies for different bug types
   - Defensive programming techniques to prevent bugs

5. **Profiling** (`05_profiling.py`)
   - Measuring code performance
   - Using timeit for microbenchmarking
   - Profiling with cProfile
   - Identifying bottlenecks
   - Common performance issues in Python

6. **Real-World Debugging** (`06_real_world_debugging.py`)
   - Debugging complex systems
   - Dealing with bugs that span multiple modules
   - Debugging third-party libraries
   - Collaborative debugging strategies
   - Case studies of complex bugs

7. **Debugging Project** (`07_debugging_project.py`)
   - A capstone project with multiple deliberate bugs
   - Practice applying debugging techniques in a realistic scenario
   - Hands-on exercises for fixing different types of bugs

## How to Use This Material

Each lesson file contains:

1. Instructor notes at the top, explaining the teaching objectives and key points
2. Code examples demonstrating the concepts
3. Explanatory comments to guide understanding
4. Exercises for hands-on practice

For instructors, go through the instructor notes and ensure you understand the debugging techniques before teaching the session. For self-learners, work through each file sequentially, experimenting with the code examples and completing the exercises.

## Installing Required Tools

To follow along with this course, you will need:

1. Python 3.7 or newer
2. VS Code with the Python extension installed
3. The standard library modules used in the examples

No additional packages are required as we focus on built-in debugging and profiling tools.
