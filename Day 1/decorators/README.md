# Python Function Decorators

Welcome to the "Building and Using Function Decorators" course! This module is designed to provide you with a comprehensive understanding of Python function decorators, from basic concepts to advanced patterns and real-world applications.

## Course Overview

Function decorators are a powerful and elegant feature of Python that allow you to extend and modify the behavior of functions without directly changing their code. This course will take you from the fundamentals to advanced decorator patterns used in professional Python development.

## Prerequisites

- Good understanding of Python fundamentals
- Familiarity with functions and how they work in Python
- Basic understanding of nested functions and closures

## Course Structure

The course is divided into nine progressive lessons, each building on the concepts of the previous one:

1. **Functions as Objects** (`01_functions_as_objects.py`)
   - Understanding functions as first-class objects in Python
   - Assigning functions to variables
   - Passing functions as arguments
   - Functions returning functions

2. **Decorator Foundations** (`02_decorator_foundations.py`)
   - Core decorator pattern without syntax
   - Enhancing functions with wrappers
   - Adding functionality before and after function execution

3. **Decorator Syntax** (`03_decorator_syntax.py`)
   - Using the `@` syntax for decorators
   - Order of decorator application
   - Stacking multiple decorators

4. **Preserving Metadata** (`04_preserving_metadata.py`)
   - The problem of losing function metadata
   - Using `functools.wraps` to preserve metadata
   - Practical implications for debugging and documentation

5. **Decorators with Arguments** (`05_decorators_with_arguments.py`)
   - Creating configurable decorators
   - Decorator factories
   - Advanced decorator patterns with parameters

6. **Class-Based Decorators** (`06_class_decorators.py`)
   - Implementing decorators as classes
   - The `__call__` method
   - Stateful decorators

7. **Method and Class Decorators** (`07_method_class_decorators.py`)
   - Decorating instance methods, class methods, and static methods
   - Built-in method decorators (`@classmethod`, `@staticmethod`, `@property`)
   - Decorating entire classes

8. **Practical Decorator Patterns** (`08_practical_decorator_patterns.py`)
   - Real-world decorator examples
   - Common patterns: memoization, authentication, validation
   - Decorators in popular frameworks

9. **Debugging and Testing** (`09_debugging_and_testing.py`)
   - Challenges of debugging decorated functions
   - Testing functions with decorators
   - Best practices and common pitfalls

## How to Use This Course

To get the most out of this course:
- Work through the files in order
- Run the examples to see how they work
- Try to solve the exercises before looking at the solutions
- Experiment by modifying the examples or creating your own
