# Python Advanced: Iterators, Generators, and Context Managers

## Course Overview

This module covers Python's powerful iteration tools and resource management patterns. We explore the core concepts that make Python code more efficient, elegant, and Pythonic.

## Instructor Notes

Each Python file in this module contains detailed instructor notes at the top of the file, enclosed in triple quotes. These notes include:

- Teaching goals for that specific lesson
- Key points to cover during instruction
- A suggested teaching flow
- Potential questions to ask students
- Common misconceptions to address

## Course Content

### 1. Iteration Fundamentals (`01_iteration_fundamentals.py`)
- Understanding Python's iterator protocol
- How for loops work under the hood
- The difference between iterables and iterators
- Building custom iterator classes

### 2. Advanced Iterator Patterns (`02_advanced_iterators.py`)
- Separating iterables and iterators (proper implementation)
- Infinite iterators with safety mechanisms
- Practical iterator patterns (chunking, filtering)
- Combining iterator patterns

### 3. Generators Introduction (`03_generators_intro.py`)
- Creating generators with the yield statement
- State preservation between generator function calls
- Generator expressions vs. list comprehensions
- Memory efficiency benefits
- Building generator pipelines

### 4. Advanced Generator Features (`04_advanced_generators.py`)
- The yield from statement for delegating to sub-generators
- Two-way communication with generators using send()
- Exception handling with throw() and close()
- Coroutine basics and generator-based pipelines
- Practical data processing examples

### 5. The itertools Module (`05_itertools_module.py`)
- Infinite iterators (count, cycle, repeat)
- Terminating iterators (chain, compress, filter)
- Combinatoric generators (product, permutations, combinations)
- Performance benefits of itertools
- Practical examples and patterns

### 6. Context Managers (`06_context_managers.py`)
- The with statement and resource management
- Creating context managers with classes (__enter__ and __exit__)
- Creating context managers with generators (@contextmanager)
- Error handling in context managers
- Practical context manager examples and patterns

### 7. Practical Applications (`07_practical_applications.py`)
- Comprehensive case studies combining all concepts
- Log file analysis pipelines
- Data transformation and validation systems
- Memory-efficient data processing patterns
- Real-world applications of these concepts

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Understand and implement Python's iterator protocol
2. Create memory-efficient generators for data processing
3. Use itertools for complex data transformations
4. Build custom context managers for clean resource handling
5. Design elegant, Pythonic data processing pipelines
6. Apply these concepts to solve real-world programming challenges

## Prerequisites

- Solid understanding of Python fundamentals
- Familiarity with functions and basic object-oriented programming
- Experience with file handling and error management

## Target Audience

- Intermediate Python developers looking to advance their skills
- Software engineers wanting to write more efficient Python code
- Data engineers working with large datasets
- Anyone wanting to write more Pythonic code

## Running the Examples

Each file in this module can be run as a standalone Python script:

```bash
python 01_iteration_fundamentals.py
```

Most examples include executable code that demonstrates the concepts, with output that explains what's happening.
