# Advanced Python Topics

## Course Structure Overview

- **Day 1**: Function Decorators, Iterators/Generators, and Advanced OOP
- **Day 2**: Python Packaging, Data Analysis, and Debugging
- **Day 3**: Testing, Async Programming, and Database Integration

## Teaching Approach

This course is designed for experienced Python developers who already understand basic OOP concepts. The teaching style should:

1. **Be interactive** - Encourage questions and discussion
2. **Use concrete examples** - Always ground abstract concepts in practical code
3. **Build incrementally** - Start simple and add complexity gradually
4. **Provide context** - Explain not just how, but why and when to use these patterns
5. **Connect to real-world use** - Reference how these patterns are used in real frameworks
